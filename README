Running git in cmd on windows machines requires additional work. The 'git.exe' 
provided by msysgit project requires several DLL-files. These files get 
installed in '%msysgit%\mingw\bin' by default. You have to provide following 
DLLs in '%mysysgit%\git' (e.g. copy them):
 - libcrypto.dll
 - libcurl-4.dll
 - libiconv2.dll
 - libssl.dll
 - pthreadGC2.dll
