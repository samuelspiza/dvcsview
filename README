dvcsview - prints status summary for DVCS repositories

This tool helps to get an overview of the status of Git and Mercurial 
repositories. The script searches for all repos in your workspaces and prints
a short statusoverview. It checks for uncommited changes in the working 
directory and if configured pull/push-repos are in sync.

Dvcsview is hosted on Github. Checkout:
http://github.com/samuelspiza/dvcsview

Options:

-f HOSTS, --fetch=HOSTS
  Pull/push-repos on these hosts will be checked if they are in sync. Argument
  is a comma seperated list of the hosts. Hosts can be IPv4-addresses or
  domains. Windows driveletters (e.g. 'c:') and 1st level folder in the root
  directory (e.g. '/home') in Linux systems are possible too. Alias can be
  configured in '.dvcsview.conf'.

-q, --quiet
  Only one line pro repo.

A template for the '.dvcsview.conf' can be found under:
