Dvcsview helps to keep an overview over Git and Mercurial Repositories. The
Script searches all Repos in your workspaces and prints a short status 
overview. It checks for uncommited changes in the working directory and if 
configured pull/push-repos are in sync.

Dvcsview is hosted on Github. Checkout:

A template for the '.dvcsview.conf' can be found under:
