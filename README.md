dvcsview
========

This tool helps to get an overview of the status of Git and Mercurial
repositories. The script searches for all repos in your workspaces and prints
a short status overview. It checks for uncommited changes in the working
directory and if configured pull/push-repos are in sync.

[Dvcsview](http://github.com/samuelspiza/dvcsview) is hosted on Github.

The [template](http://gist.github.com/258034) contains examples for the
configuration of Dvcsview.
